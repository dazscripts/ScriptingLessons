# Printing
Printing lets you have a value appear into the console, you can do it using the `print()` function.
```lua
local NewString = "hi"
local NewNumber = 502
local NewTable = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7}

-- Print each variable
print(NewString)
print(NewNumber)
print(NewTable)
-- however this is annoying to do. we can print all of these at once by separating them with commas.

print(NewString, NewNumber, NewTable)
-- Much easier
```
