## Data Types

**What is a DataType?**
A DataType is a chunk of data that you can use inside of your scripts. <br>
Luau has 4 DataTypes however i am only gonna cover 3 of them for now. there is `Number`, `String`, `Boolean`, and `Table`. 

### Numbers
This is pretty self explanatory, its just a number

### Strings
A strung is a chunk of text you can wrap in quotation marks, if you dont wrap it in quotation marks you will get an error

```lua

'Hello! this is a String'
"Hello! this is a String"
'Hello! i can use "Quotation Marks" inside of a string like this'

-- Incorrect
Hello! this is a string
```

### Booleans
